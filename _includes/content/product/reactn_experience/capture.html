        Once selected, Reactn guides the customer through a structured and branded user experience. The app uses familiar mobile touchscreen technology, and leads the customer through a series of questions designed to draw out full and accurate feedback on any specific issue they may have encountered.

        <p>
        Feedback can include sentiment capture via a star rating mechanism. This opens up questions that can be answered using free-form text, and the Reactn app allows users to attach images and photos where necessary to illustrate the issue. Other topics can be predefined, covering areas such as cleanliness, punctuality and friendliness of staff. These can be ranked using a slider to indicate the level of satisfaction experienced by the customer.
        </p>

        Reactn is dynamic. It adapts and responds to the answers given, steering customers through the process and modifying the questions they see according to their answers, their location, the time of day, and even the weather.
        </p>
        <p>
        Because Reactn is intuitive to use, and because unnecessary questions are filtered out, the feedback exercise is brief, encouraging completion. At the end the process, customers are asked for some basic information such as name and email, so they can receive a response.
