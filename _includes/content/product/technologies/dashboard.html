    The Reactn dashboard provides a real-time visualisation of your customer feedback. This includes a range of dashboard views to reflect the common questionnaire structures, as well as data organised by focus area or combinations of questions. You can manipulate the view of the data to meet your needs – by week, by time or by location, for example.
</p>
<p>
    The dashboard offers both instant and past data. This can be data from the entire length of the feedback period, or by the past 30 days, for example. It can also aggregate all data for all relevant locations, or by specific locations, such as train carriages, toilets, even hotel rooms.
</p>

    This is complemented by a visual representation of the ticketing system, allowing you to quickly identify the number of faults or complaints, as well as establish how many have been resolved in a given day.
