    Operations professionals are coming under relentless pressure. The business landscape is constantly shifting and operations must always do more with less. You are scrutinised by wider stakeholders and ever-more exposed to the impact of operations to the bottom line.

    Reactn directly addresses the gap between marketing expectations and operations reality. Not only does Reactn help accurately measure customer sentiment and feedback, but it allows you to track changes to these metrics over time and in different areas of the business. This allows operations professionals to pinpoint areas for improvement and investment – areas that will have maximum impact on perception and performance.

    In addition, Reactn streamlines and digitises fault reporting and maintenance issues. It allows your customer-base to highlight problems across your estate on a constant and continuous basis – from individual locations, to more widespread concerns. It even allows you to integrate these reports with third-party facilities and maintenance teams. Meanwhile, Reactn’s comprehensive and sophisticated ticketing systems ensure maximum efficiency in resolving all improvements.

    Reactn targets areas of the business that are underperforming, and issues can be resolved quickly by employees on the ground. We automate this process and let the customer know what you’ve done to address their issue, freeing up time and resource.
