    A listening business is more likely to have satisfied customers, engaged employees and effective performance. Reactn places customers at the heart of your business. It provides peace of mind that your business is doing all it can to listen to customer opinions – and, more critically, act on them.
</p>
<p>
    Reactn gives you direct access to what is happening in real-time. It removes the fear that an “impervious” middle management layer is keeping customer insight from decision makers and strategic direction from employees.

<p>
    Reactn works to empower every employee in your business. It brings customer service front and centre to your strategic planning, and makes it an active and constant measure of your organisation’s performance.

    Reactn acts as a window on underperforming sites, departments and individuals. While we built a system for good, this good can sometimes mean reorganisation and change. Reactn acts as a barometer for targeting change management strategies and measuring their success.
